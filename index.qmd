I'm an associate professor at Insea (Rabat) and Télécom Paris. 
My research and interests gravitate around machine learning with a focus on optimal transport and diffusion models. I’m passionate about exploring ideas deeply and sharing them clearly. This site [in construction] is where I document and share what I’m working on.

### Short Bio
In 2021, I obtained both my Master’s and PhD degrees from ENSAE Paris, where I worked under the supervision of Alexandre Gramfort and Marco Cuturi on *optimal transport and its applications in machine learning*. My thesis manuscript is available [here](media/manuscript-hicham-janati.pdf). Following my PhD, I held a postdoctoral position at École Polytechnique, working with Rémi Flamary on *deep learning for domain adaptation*. I have been an Associate Professor at Télécom Paris since December 2021, and I joined INSEA in the same role in January 2025.
